# Object Recognition and Counting

This project implements an object recognition and counting system using Python. It leverages image processing and machine learning techniques to identify objects in a given picture and count the number of occurrences for each object.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and efficient way to:
1. Recognize objects in an image.
2. Count the number of instances of each recognized object.

It can be used in various applications such as wildlife monitoring, inventory management, and traffic analysis.

## Features

- Recognizes multiple objects in an image.
- Provides the count of each identified object.
- Supports a variety of image formats (e.g., JPG, PNG).
- Modular and extensible for adding new object classes.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras (for object detection models)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-recognition-and-counting.git
   cd object-recognition-and-counting
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the pre-trained model (e.g., YOLO, SSD, or a custom-trained model) and place it in the `models/` directory.

## Usage

1. Prepare the input image and place it in the `images/` directory.

2. Run the script to recognize and count objects:
   ```bash
   python recognize_and_count.py --image images/example.jpg
   ```

3. The results, including the recognized objects and their counts, will be displayed and saved to the `output/` directory.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.
